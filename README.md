## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a smart, multilingual, AI-powered advisory platform designed to support small and marginal farmers with real-time, personalized crop management guidance. It will be accessible through a lightweight mobile app, chatbot, and voice-based services such as IVR, SMS, and WhatsApp, ensuring even low-literate or non-smartphone users can benefit. The system will combine farmer inputs, soil test results, weather data, satellite imagery, and market price feeds to generate accurate, location-specific recommendations. Key features include soil health analysis with fertilizer guidance, weather-based alerts, pest and disease detection via image uploads, and crop planning support tailored to local conditions. The platform will also provide mandi price tracking to help farmers make better selling decisions. For ease of use, advisories will be available in regional languages, with simple icons, audio, and offline functionality. On the backend, AI and agronomy rule engines will process data, while extension officers and agricultural experts can validate or adjust advisories for higher accuracy. Farmers’ feedback and usage data will continuously improve the system through retraining of models and field validation. To ensure trust and safety, recommendations will always include clear explanations, alternative options, and pesticide safety guidelines. The solution will benefit not only farmers but also agricultural departments, NGOs, cooperatives, and agri-tech startups by creating a feedback loop of reliable, localized data. In the long term, this advisory service can improve yields, reduce input costs, lower environmental harm, and strengthen market linkages. It is also designed for sustainability through a mix of free core services, government and NGO partnerships, and premium value-added features. Ultimately, this solution empowers farmers with scientific knowledge in their native language, reduces dependency on guesswork, and promotes sustainable and profitable farming practices.

The smart advisory solution directly tackles the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers by replacing guesswork with personalized, real-time scientific guidance. By using a multilingual, AI-powered mobile app and chatbot, it ensures that farmers receive crop-specific advice in their native language, overcoming barriers of literacy and communication. Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance help prevent excessive or imbalanced use of chemicals, lowering input costs and improving soil fertility. Weather-based alerts and predictive insights allow farmers to plan irrigation, spraying, and harvesting more effectively, reducing crop losses due to climate variability. Pest and disease detection through image uploads provides timely identification and safe treatment options, minimizing yield losses while promoting eco-friendly practices. Market price tracking enables farmers to make better selling decisions, ensuring fairer incomes. Voice support makes the platform inclusive for farmers with low digital literacy, while continuous feedback and usage data collection ensure that the system improves over time and remains relevant to local needs. By combining modern technology with accessible design, the solution empowers farmers to make informed decisions, increases productivity, reduces costs, and promotes sustainable agriculture. It also creates a strong support network involving extension officers, NGOs, government bodies, and agri-tech startups, ensuring that farmers are not isolated but part of a collaborative ecosystem. Ultimately, this solution bridges the gap between traditional practices and modern agri-tech, making farming more profitable, resilient, and environmentally sustainable.

The innovation of this solution lies in its ability to integrate multiple technologies—AI, machine learning, remote sensing, and weather forecasting—into a single, farmer-friendly platform that delivers actionable advice in real time. Unlike traditional advisory systems that are generic and one-directional, this solution is highly personalized, accounting for soil type, crop history, and local weather conditions. Its uniqueness comes from being multilingual, voice-enabled, and designed for low-literate users, ensuring inclusivity for farmers who are often excluded from digital tools due to language and literacy barriers. The use of image-based pest and disease detection adds another innovative dimension, allowing farmers to visually identify problems without needing technical knowledge. Moreover, the system is designed with a continuous feedback loop, where farmer inputs and field data are used to refine recommendations, making the platform smarter over time. By combining scientific accuracy with cultural and linguistic accessibility, the solution stands out as both technologically advanced and farmer-centric, bridging the gap between cutting-edge agri-tech and grassroots farming needs.
